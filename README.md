# PHost - Easy way to create virtual hosts! :shell:

Hi! Thanks so much for choose PHost! :smiley: 


# How to use it ?! 
- First, clone the repository in the path of your web server (/var/www/html or /srv/http), like: 
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ git clone https://github.com/ekkopy/phost.git /var/www/html/phost
```
- After, we'll run the PHost with sudo (we need to use sudo for apply changes in protected files):
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:/var/html/phost $  sudo php phost.php
```
Can you see it ?! PHost is very easy!

### OBS: Until the date, PHost works only on ubuntu 18.04+, Mint  19 and all ubuntu like!
